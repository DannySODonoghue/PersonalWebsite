# Website
My first website that I'm really using for practice

Although I don't really think a README is necessary for this particular project I understand
that they are highly encouraged for these kinds of things anyway.

My hope for this project is to have a bunch of tabs that bring me to different pages, such 
as soccer, movies, music, etc. Each will be kind of like a blog with playlists that connect
to spotify, collections of photos, reviews and live rankings of movies i've seen.

I'm really trying to be as creative as possible within the scope of my own programming abilities--
which hopefully, with practice, will improve in tandem with each other.
